#  Stacks and Queues
 
 1. Stacks
      - Data structure contains nodes, each node reference to its next node but does not reference its previous.
 2. Queue
      - Queues can be implemented in JavaScript using arrays, by using the push or unshift functions to add items to one end of the array, and the shift or pop functions to remove them from the other. This method, while simple, is inefficient for large queues as the shift and unshift functions move every item in the array.

## Challenge
     
     - Creat Stack Queue and test there functionality.Â
