# Hashtables 

  - Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

         add: hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
         get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
         contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
         hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
 
## Challenge
     
     - Crate hash-table data Structure.Â 

#### Tests Only for the first CC
      
      - console.log()
    
## Big O

     - add  ---- > for [ time and space] O(1) ------- > constant time. 
     - get  ---- > for [ time and space] O(1) ------- > constant time. 
     - contains  ---- > for [ time and space] O(1) ------- > constant time. 
     - hash  ---- > for [ time and space] O(1) ------- > constant time.
